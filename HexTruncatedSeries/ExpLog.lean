/-!
Formal logarithm and exponential at a fixed precision.

The logarithm integrates `a' / a`; the explicit final truncation handles the
precision-zero identity `n - 1 + 1 = 1`.  Exponential uses the bounded Newton
update `y ↦ y * (1 + a - log y)`.  Neither operation searches for a unit:
the logarithm uses the literal inverse witness `1`, so only the
precision-indexed `NatInverses` capability is required.
