# hex-truncated-series (fixed-precision truncated power series, depends on hex-basic)

Power series over a commutative ring, truncated at a precision fixed in
the type, with the ring operations, precision changes, Newton iteration
for inverse, square root, `exp` and `log`, and composition and
reversion. Mathlib-free. The companion `hex-truncated-series-mathlib`
identifies the type with `PowerSeries R` modulo `X ^ n` and identifies
each operation with its Mathlib counterpart where one exists.

This SPEC expands the "Truncated power series" entry of
[future-work](../../SPEC/future-work.md). It does not specify fast polynomial
division, fast polynomial remainder, or any conversion to `DensePoly`.
Those belong to the planned [hex-poly-fast](../../SPEC/Libraries/hex-poly-fast.md), which depends
on both this library and hex-poly. The reason is given under "Placement in
the DAG".

## Why this library exists

**Newton iteration on a truncated series is the primitive under fast
polynomial division.** Dividing `f` by `g` in degree `d` is inverting
the reversal of `g` to precision `d + 1` and multiplying. hex-poly
divides schoolbook, so every consumer that divides large polynomials
pays `O(d²)` where `O(M(d))` is available. Half-gcd, fast modular
composition, and fast Padé approximation all reduce to the same
inversion.

**The series operations are wanted for their own sake.** `exp`, `log`,
square root, composition and reversion of series appear in generating
function manipulation, in Hensel-style lifting where the modulus is a
power of `x` rather than a power of `p`, and in the coefficient
extraction that combinatorial identities need. None of that requires a
polynomial type.

**Nothing in the tree computes with a truncated series today.**
`HexBerlekampZassenhaus/QuadraticNormRecover.lean:74` has a one-off
formal logarithm of a series with constant term `1`, written for the
quadratic-norm recovery step and correct only there. That is the whole
of it. A library with a stated precision contract replaces that
one-off and makes the next such need a call rather than another
one-off.

**The precision contract is the interesting theorem, and it is easy to
get wrong.** An operation on inputs correct to precision `n` must
return a result correct to precision `n`, and the operations that lose
precision must lose a stated amount. Writing that down once, with the
hypotheses each algorithm actually needs, is most of the value here.

## Placement in the DAG

The dependency is hex-basic and nothing else.

```text
hex-basic ── hex-truncated-series ── hex-truncated-series-mathlib
```

The planned consumer joins this library to hex-poly:

```text
hex-poly ─────────────┐
                      ├── hex-poly-fast
hex-truncated-series ──┘
```

**No edge runs from this library to hex-poly, and none may be added.**
Reversal of a `DensePoly`, fast division, fast remainder, and fast
`gcd` all live in hex-poly-fast, above both. If instead this library
converted to and from `DensePoly` it would depend on hex-poly, and
hex-poly's own fast division would then depend on this library, which
is a cycle in the release graph as well as in the build. The release
graph is the harder constraint: `scripts/release/released.yml` lists
repositories in topological order and rewrites each one's Lake pins, so
a cycle is not merely inconvenient there, it has no valid publication
order.

The graph with the planned consumer is acyclic, and it is acyclic for a
reason that survives future additions: this library names no polynomial
type at all. Its whole interface is coefficient vectors of a fixed
length. A reviewer checking acyclicity does not have to trace hex-poly's
imports, only to check that `HexTruncatedSeries/*.lean` imports nothing
but `HexBasic` and `Std`.

The companion adds an edge to Mathlib and to nothing else, so the
Mathlib-side graph is `hex-truncated-series-mathlib → hex-truncated-series`
and `hex-truncated-series-mathlib → Mathlib`. It does not depend on
hex-poly-mathlib, because it states nothing about polynomials.

## Why hex-basic and not hex-poly

Three reasons.

**`DensePoly` carries a normalisation invariant this type must not
have.** `DensePolyNormalized` (`HexPoly/Dense.lean:26`) says the
coefficient array has no trailing zeros, which is what makes structural
equality agree with equality of polynomials. A truncated series at
precision `n` has exactly `n` coefficients, trailing zeros included, and
its equality is equality of all `n` of them. Reusing `DensePoly` would
mean renormalising after every operation and would conflate "the
coefficient is zero" with "the coefficient is beyond the precision",
which is the one distinction the whole precision contract rests on.

**hex-basic supplies three things this library needs and hex-poly
cannot use.** `Hex.instDecidableEqVector` and `Hex.Vector.ofFn'`
(`HexBasic/ArrayDecEq.lean`, `HexBasic/OfFn.lean`) are kernel-reducible
replacements for the `Vector` instances in Lean core, whose bodies are
unavailable across a module boundary so that `decide` stalls on them.
`HexBasic.Fold` is the `List.foldl` algebra over a bare
`Lean.Grind.Semiring` that the convolution sum below is stated with.
hex-poly has no dependencies at all, which is why its own
`DecidableEq (DensePoly R)` carries a hand-written copy of the same
workaround with a comment saying it cannot import `HexBasic.ArrayDecEq`
(`HexPoly/Dense.lean:45-54`). Building the series type on hex-basic
avoids repeating that.

**A fixed-length vector is the right shape for Newton iteration.** Every
step writes a prefix of a buffer of known size. `Vector R n` says the
size is known and lets `Hex.Vector.modify` reuse a uniquely owned
buffer, per design principle 3. An array whose length is a runtime
value would reallocate per step.

The one thing lost is the convolution fold, roughly twenty lines and two
lemmas, which hex-poly also has (`HexPoly/Euclid/MulRing.lean`). That
duplication is deliberate and is cheaper than either a cycle or a new
hex-basic home that hex-poly still could not import. The open questions
record the alternative.

## Scope

In scope: the type and its coefficient semantics; the commutative ring
structure; truncation, zero extension, multiplication and division by
powers of `x`, derivative and integral; inversion, square root, `exp`,
`log`, composition, and reversion, each with its own hypotheses; the
Newton driver and its step-count theorem; and the companion's
correspondence with `PowerSeries R`.

Not in scope, and deliberately: any conversion to or from `DensePoly`;
fast polynomial division, remainder, or `gcd`; multipoint evaluation;
half-gcd; multivariate series; series with a variable precision carried
at runtime rather than in the type; Laurent series and negative
valuations; and any search for a square root of the constant term,
which is a problem in the coefficient ring and belongs there.

## The representation

```lean
namespace Hex

/-- A power series over `R` truncated at precision `n`: the coefficients
of `x^0` through `x^(n-1)`, with no normalisation invariant. -/
structure TSeries (R : Type u) (n : Nat) where
  /-- The stored coefficients in ascending degree order. -/
  coeffs : Vector R n

namespace TSeries

variable {R : Type u} {n : Nat} [Lean.Grind.CommRing R]

/-- The `i`th coefficient, and `0` for `i ≥ n`. Every theorem below is
stated with this total reading rather than with a `Fin n` index. -/
@[expose] def coeff (a : TSeries R n) (i : Nat) : R :=
  if h : i < n then a.coeffs[i] else 0

/-- Tabulate a series from a coefficient function. -/
@[expose] def ofFn (f : Nat → R) : TSeries R n :=
  ⟨Hex.Vector.ofFn' fun i => f i.1⟩

theorem coeff_ofFn (f : Nat → R) (i : Nat) (hi : i < n) :
    (ofFn (n := n) f).coeff i = f i

/-- Two series at the same precision are equal when they agree at every
index below the precision. -/
@[ext] theorem ext {a b : TSeries R n} (h : ∀ i, i < n → a.coeff i = b.coeff i) :
    a = b

instance [DecidableEq R] : DecidableEq (TSeries R n)
```

**`[DecidableEq R]` is not a global variable.** `coeff`, `ofFn`, the
ring operations, the precision changes, and every witness-taking
algorithm (`invOfUnit`, `sqrtOfRoot`, `revOfUnit`, `exp`, `log`, `comp`)
decide no coefficient equality and do not take it. It appears on the
`DecidableEq (TSeries R n)` instance above and on the operations that
test a coefficient: `valuation?`, `divXPow?`, `comp?`, and the `Option`
forms that consult `UnitOps`. Declaring it once at the top of the
library would be convenient and would quietly exclude coefficient rings
without decidable equality from the whole interface.

`coeff` returning `0` above the precision is a convenience for stating
theorems, not a claim about the series. The distinction matters and is
the subject of "Degenerate precisions" below: `a.coeff n = 0` says
nothing about the series `a` approximates.

The precision lives in the type. A caller that needs a precision known
only at runtime writes `(n : Nat) → TSeries R n` and passes it, which is
what the composition and reversion routines do internally. A runtime
precision field on the structure was rejected because it would put an
inequality side condition on every coefficient lemma and would defeat
the `Vector` length reuse that makes the iteration allocate once.

## Coefficientwise semantics

The whole contract is coefficientwise, and there is no separate
semantic function to relate the type to. `TSeries R n` **is** the ring
`R[[x]] / (x^n)`, presented by its coefficients, and the companion
proves that identification rather than the Mathlib-free layer assuming
it.

The convolution sum is stated Mathlib-free as a fold:

```lean
/-- The `i`th coefficient of a product of two coefficient functions. -/
@[expose] def convCoeff (f g : Nat → R) (i : Nat) : R :=
  (List.range (i + 1)).foldl (fun acc j => acc + f j * g (i - j)) 0
```

`HexBasic.Fold` supplies the `foldl` algebra over `Lean.Grind.Semiring`
that the lemmas about `convCoeff` need, so this is a short definition
with short proofs rather than a re-derivation of fold associativity.

## The ring structure

```lean
instance : Zero (TSeries R n)
instance : One (TSeries R n)
instance : Add (TSeries R n)
instance : Neg (TSeries R n)
instance : Sub (TSeries R n)
instance : Mul (TSeries R n)

/-- The constant series. -/
def C (c : R) : TSeries R n
/-- The series `x`, which is `0` when `n ≤ 1`. -/
def X : TSeries R n
/-- `a ^ k` by square-and-multiply. -/
def pow (a : TSeries R n) (k : Nat) : TSeries R n

theorem coeff_zero (i) : (0 : TSeries R n).coeff i = 0
theorem coeff_one  (i) (hi : i < n) : (1 : TSeries R n).coeff i = if i = 0 then 1 else 0
theorem coeff_add  (a b) (i) (hi : i < n) : (a + b).coeff i = a.coeff i + b.coeff i
theorem coeff_neg  (a)   (i) (hi : i < n) : (-a).coeff i = -a.coeff i
theorem coeff_mul  (a b) (i) (hi : i < n) : (a * b).coeff i = convCoeff a.coeff b.coeff i
theorem coeff_C    (c)   (i) (hi : i < n) : (C c : TSeries R n).coeff i = if i = 0 then c else 0
theorem coeff_X          (i) (hi : i < n) : (X : TSeries R n).coeff i = if i = 1 then 1 else 0

instance : Lean.Grind.CommRing (TSeries R n)
```

`pow` is square-and-multiply, not iterated multiplication, per design
principle 7. Every operation above is total and needs no hypothesis
beyond `Lean.Grind.CommRing R`.

**Multiplication also has a bounded form, and the Newton iterations use
it.** Computing only the coefficients below a bound `m` is what makes a
doubling iteration cost a geometric series rather than a fixed multiple
of the full-precision cost:

```lean
/-- The product, with every coefficient at index `m` or above set to
zero. Its logical body is the bounded schoolbook convolution. -/
def mulUpTo (m : Nat) (a b : TSeries R n) : TSeries R n

/-- The allocation-conscious schoolbook implementation of `mulUpTo`. -/
def mulUpToImpl (m : Nat) (a b : TSeries R n) : TSeries R n

@[csimp] theorem mulUpTo_eq_impl : @mulUpTo = @mulUpToImpl

theorem coeff_mulUpTo (m) (a b) (i) (hi : i < n) :
    (mulUpTo m a b).coeff i = if i < m then (a * b).coeff i else 0
```

`mulUpTo n = (· * ·)` up to the propositional equality above. The Newton
iterations use `mulUpTo` so each step computes only its useful prefix rather
than repeatedly paying for the final precision.

**The generic multiplication contract is schoolbook.** Both `mulUpTo` and its
compiled implementation intentionally require only `Zero`, `Add`, and `Mul`.
Three-product Karatsuba needs subtraction to recover its middle term, so it
cannot implement this signature over every admitted coefficient type. A
future subtraction-capable fast path must therefore be a separately typed API
with an explicit dispatch story; it must not be described as the compiled
replacement for this semiring-generic definition.

[hex-poly-fast](../../SPEC/Libraries/hex-poly-fast.md) owns polynomial reversal and a separate
plan-driven Newton inverse. That inverse is proved equal to `invOfUnit` after
conversion, but it does not modify this function or route a coefficient-
specific NTT/Kronecker plan into this library. This deliberate duplication
keeps the DAG acyclic.

## Degenerate precisions

**Precision zero.** `TSeries R 0` has exactly one element, `0 = 1`, and
it is the zero ring. `Lean.Grind.CommRing` does not require
nontriviality, so the instance holds and nothing needs a special case.
Every coefficient theorem above carries `i < n`, so at `n = 0` they are
all vacuous, and `coeff i = 0` for every `i`.

This is not a curiosity, and it is where a careless hypothesis becomes
wrong. In the zero ring **every** element is a unit, every element has a
square root, and every element is invertible under composition. So an
operation that is partial at positive precision is total at precision
zero, and its success condition has to say so. Concretely:

- `a.coeff 0 = 0` for every `a : TSeries R 0`, so a hypothesis "the
  constant term is a unit" is *false* at precision zero over any
  nontrivial `R`, while the conclusion it guards is *true* there.
- A hypothesis "the constant term is `1`" is likewise false, while
  "`(a - 1).coeff 0 = 0`" is true. The two agree for `n ≥ 1`, and only
  the second is right at `n = 0`.

The rule this library follows, stated once and applied everywhere: **a
hypothesis about a coefficient is written as an equation that is
automatically satisfied out of range, and a success condition is written
as an existence statement in `TSeries R n` rather than as a condition on
a coefficient.** So `log` takes `(a - 1).coeff 0 = 0` and not
`a.coeff 0 = 1`, and `inv?` succeeds exactly when the argument is a unit
of `TSeries R n`, which at `n = 0` is always.

**Precision one.** `TSeries R 1` is `R`, by `coeff 0`. `X = 0` there, so
composition and reversion are the identity on the single element `0` and
succeed with no hypothesis on a linear coefficient (there is no linear
coefficient). Precision zero is where a hypothesis on the constant term
is false while its conclusion holds, and precision one is where a
hypothesis on the linear term is.

**Precision two and the first real hypothesis.** At `n = 2` the linear
coefficient exists, and reversion is the first operation whose
hypothesis has content. `exp` and `log` first need a division by an
integer other than `1` at `n = 3`.

## Precision changes

```lean
/-- Discard the coefficients at index `m` and above. -/
def truncate (a : TSeries R n) (m : Nat) (h : m ≤ n) : TSeries R m
/-- Pad with zeros to a larger precision. See the warning below. -/
def extend (a : TSeries R n) (m : Nat) (h : n ≤ m) : TSeries R m
/-- Multiply by `x ^ k`, discarding the top `k` coefficients. -/
def mulXPow (a : TSeries R n) (k : Nat) : TSeries R n
/-- Divide by `x ^ k`, or `none` when the bottom `k` coefficients are
not all zero. The precision drops by `k`. -/
def divXPow? (a : TSeries R n) (k : Nat) : Option (TSeries R (n - k))
/-- The index of the lowest nonzero coefficient, or `none` when every
stored coefficient is zero. -/
def valuation? (a : TSeries R n) : Option Nat
/-- The formal derivative. The precision drops by one. -/
def deriv (a : TSeries R n) : TSeries R (n - 1)

theorem coeff_truncate (i) (hi : i < m) : (a.truncate m h).coeff i = a.coeff i
theorem coeff_extend   (i) (hi : i < m) : (a.extend m h).coeff i = a.coeff i
theorem truncate_extend : (a.extend m h).truncate n h' = a
theorem coeff_mulXPow  (i) (hi : i < n) :
    (a.mulXPow k).coeff i = if k ≤ i then a.coeff (i - k) else 0
theorem divXPow?_eq_some_iff (b : TSeries R (n - k)) :
    divXPow? a k = some b ↔
      (∀ i, i < min k n → a.coeff i = 0) ∧
        ∀ i, i < n - k → b.coeff i = a.coeff (i + k)
theorem divXPow?_mulXPow :
    divXPow? (a.mulXPow k) k =
      some (a.truncate (n - k) (Nat.sub_le n k))
theorem valuation?_eq_some_iff :
    valuation? a = some k ↔
      k < n ∧ a.coeff k ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ i, i < k → a.coeff i = 0
theorem valuation?_eq_none_iff_eq_zero : valuation? a = none ↔ a = 0
theorem coeff_deriv    (i) (hi : i < n - 1) :
    a.deriv.coeff i = ((i + 1 : Nat) : R) * a.coeff (i + 1)
```

`truncate` is a ring homomorphism and the theorem saying so is the
statement the whole library is organised around:

```lean
theorem truncate_mul (a b : TSeries R n) (h : m ≤ n) :
    (a * b).truncate m h = a.truncate m h * b.truncate m h
```

**`extend` is not a ring homomorphism, and the SPEC says so loudly
because the type does not.** At `n = 2` take `a = b = X`. Then
`a * b = 0`, so `extend 3 (a * b) = 0`, while
`extend 3 a * extend 3 b = X ^ 2 ≠ 0`. Zero padding invents information:
it asserts that the coefficients above the old precision are zero, which
is true only when the input is known to be a polynomial of degree below
`n`. `extend` is therefore documented as valid only for such inputs, it
carries no multiplicativity lemma, and no routine in this library calls
it on a value produced by a Newton iteration.

**Precision preservation and loss**, for inputs at precision `n`:

| operation | output precision | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `+`, `-`, `*`, `pow`, `C`, `X` | `n` | exact |
| `mulUpTo m` | `n`, correct below `m` | the bounded form |
| `truncate m` | `m` | exact, a ring homomorphism |
| `extend m` | `m` | not a ring homomorphism, see above |
| `mulXPow k` | `n` | the top `k` input coefficients are discarded |
| `divXPow? k` | `n - k` | genuine loss of `k`, recorded in the type |
| `deriv` | `n - 1` | genuine loss of one |
| `integrate` | `n + 1` | a gain, needs `1/k` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n` |
| `inv`, `sqrt`, `exp`, `log` | `n` | preserved, by the Newton contract |
| `comp` | `n` | preserved, given `b.coeff 0 = 0` |
| `rev` | `n` | preserved, given `b.coeff 1` a unit |

The two rows with a genuine loss put it in the type rather than in a
docstring. A caller who wants `n` coefficients out of `divXPow? k`
computes at precision `n + k`, and the type is what tells them.

## What each algorithm needs

The generic part of the interface is the ring structure and the
precision changes, and it needs nothing beyond `Lean.Grind.CommRing R`.
Each algorithm on top carries its own hypotheses,
stated separately, because they are genuinely different hypotheses
satisfied by different coefficient rings.

```lean
/-- A partial inverse operation on the coefficient ring. -/
class UnitOps (R : Type u) where
  inv? : R → Option R

/-- The laws `inv?` must satisfy: sound on `some`, and complete, so that
`inv?` detects every unit. -/
class LawfulUnitOps (R : Type u) [Lean.Grind.CommRing R] [UnitOps R] : Prop where
  inv?_eq  : ∀ a u, UnitOps.inv? a = some u → a * u = 1
  inv?_isSome : ∀ a, (∃ u, a * u = 1) → (UnitOps.inv? a).isSome

/-- Inverses of the integers `1` through `m` in `R`. Precision-indexed,
because that is what the algorithms actually need. -/
class NatInverses (R : Type u) [Lean.Grind.CommRing R] (m : Nat) where
  invNat : Nat → R
  invNat_eq : ∀ k, 1 ≤ k → k ≤ m → (k : R) * invNat k = 1
```

**`NatInverses` is indexed by the precision on purpose, and that index
is the point of the class.** Over `ℤ` the instance holds at `m = 1` and
fails at `m = 2`, so `exp` and `log` over `ℤ` exist up to precision `2`
and not beyond, which is correct: `exp(x)` truncated at precision `3` is
`1 + x + x²/2`, and `1/2 ∉ ℤ`. A class stated as "`R` is a
`ℚ`-algebra", or an unstated assumption that a coefficient can be
divided by a small integer, would either exclude precision `2` over `ℤ`
or would be false.

Over `ZMod q` the instance holds exactly when every `k` with
`1 ≤ k ≤ m` is coprime to `q`. **For a prime `p` that is `m < p`, and
the primality is not decoration**: over `ZMod 4` the instance already
fails at `m = 2`, so the clean statement needs `p` prime and the
instance is stated for `ZMod64.PrimeModulus`. Feeding that through the
`n - 1` index, `exp` and `log` over `ZMod p` exist for `n - 1 < p`, that
is **through precision `p` inclusive** and not merely below it. At
`n = p` the divisions are by `1, …, p - 1`, all invertible; at
`n = p + 1` the division by `p` appears and there is no instance.

`NatInverses R m` implies `NatInverses R m'` for `m' ≤ m`. That is
supplied as `NatInverses.mono`, a `def` and not an `instance`, since as
an instance it loops.

Instances shipped here: `NatInverses R 0` and `NatInverses R 1` for
**every** `R`, since those requirements are respectively vacuous and
discharged by `1 * 1 = 1`; `NatInverses Rat m` for every `m`, at a lower
priority so it does not shadow the two generic ones; `UnitOps Rat`,
`UnitOps Int`, and the matching `LawfulUnitOps` instances for both. The
two generic instances are what make the claim "`exp` and `log` at
precisions `0` and `1` work over any ring" a fact about instance
resolution rather than only about the proposition being satisfiable.

The core also ships higher-priority instances for the syntactic indices
`0 - k`, `k - k`, and `2 - 1`. They are intentionally redundant at the
proposition level: all three reduce to bounds `0` or `1`. They are present
because typeclass matching across module boundaries does not reliably reduce
the subtraction before matching the generic `0` and `1` instances. These are
the only subtraction-shaped instances; arbitrary weakening continues to use
the explicit `NatInverses.mono` definition so instance search cannot loop.

The `ZMod64 p` instances are **not**
here, because `ZMod64` is hex-mod-arith's type and depending on
hex-mod-arith would add an edge this library does not need. They belong
in whichever library has both types in scope, which in practice is
hex-poly-fp or another consumer. The open questions record the alternative.

Per-algorithm hypotheses, collected:

| algorithm | needs |
|---|---|
| `invOfUnit a u` | `a.coeff 0 * u = 1` |
| `inv?` | `[UnitOps R] [LawfulUnitOps R]` |
| `sqrtOfRoot a r v` | `r * r = a.coeff 0` and `((1 + 1) * r) * v = 1` |
| `sqrt? a r` | `[UnitOps R] [LawfulUnitOps R]`, and `r` from the caller |
| `exp` | `a.coeff 0 = 0` and `[NatInverses R (n - 1)]` |
| `log` | `(a - 1).coeff 0 = 0` and `[NatInverses R (n - 1)]` |
| `comp?`, `rev?`, `inv?`, `sqrt?` | additionally `[LawfulUnitOps R]` |
| `comp a b` | `b.coeff 0 = 0` |
| `revOfUnit b v` | `b.coeff 0 = 0` and `b.coeff 1 * v = 1` |

Note what is **not** in the table. `comp` needs no invertibility of any
kind. `revOfUnit` needs no integer inverses, and the section on
reversion explains why the obvious formula would have needed them.

## Failure behaviour

Two forms per partial algorithm, and no third form.

**A witness-taking total form.** `invOfUnit`, `sqrtOfRoot`, `revOfUnit`
take the witness that makes the algorithm work as an argument and are
total functions with no failure branch. They are the primary form, they
are what the correctness theorems are stated about, and they mirror
Mathlib's `PowerSeries.invOfUnit`.

**An `Option`-returning form** that looks for the witness using the
coefficient ring's `UnitOps`, and returns `none` when there is none.

**The witness-taking forms are total without being fallbacks, and the
distinction is the one design principle 8 turns on.** `invOfUnit a u`
runs the same code for every `u`; there is no branch that tests `u` and
returns something else. Given a `u` that does not invert `a.coeff 0` it
returns a well-defined series that is not an inverse, and
`invOfUnit_mul` simply does not apply. The same holds for `comp a b`
with `b.coeff 0 ≠ 0`, which is the fold `Σ_{k<n} a_k b^k` in every case
and is the composition only under the hypothesis. Principle 8 is about a
`none` branch given a stand-in value, and there is no such branch here.

There is **no** total form that falls back to a junk value on failure.
Design principle 8 requires any such form to be classified as
`unreachable-by-pipeline-invariant` or `audited-emergency-value`, and
neither classification applies here: an inverse of a series whose
constant term is a nonunit does not exist, so no invariant makes the
branch unreachable and no value is mathematically safer than reporting
failure. A caller who wants a total function supplies the witness.

The success conditions, each with the precision-zero disjunct that
"Degenerate precisions" requires:

```lean
theorem inv?_isSome_iff (a : TSeries R n) :
    (inv? a).isSome = true ↔ n = 0 ∨ ∃ u, a.coeff 0 * u = 1

theorem rev?_isSome_iff (b : TSeries R n) :
    (rev? b).isSome = true ↔
      b.coeff 0 = 0 ∧ (n ≤ 1 ∨ ∃ v, b.coeff 1 * v = 1)

theorem sqrt?_isSome_iff (a : TSeries R n) (r : R) :
    (sqrt? a r).isSome = true ↔
      n = 0 ∨
        (r * r = a.coeff 0 ∧ (n ≤ 1 ∨ ∃ v, ((1 + 1) * r) * v = 1))
```

**Where the degenerate disjunct goes is different for each of the
three, and getting it wrong is how a hypothesis becomes false.** For
`inv?` the whole condition collapses at `n = 0` and nowhere else. For
`rev?` the linear-coefficient half collapses at `n ≤ 1` but the
constant-coefficient half does **not**: `rev? (C 1 : TSeries R 1)` must
be `none`, because `comp (C 1) y = C 1` for every `y` and `C 1 ≠ 0 = X`
at precision one over a nontrivial `R`. For `sqrt?` the unit half
collapses at `n ≤ 1` while the root equation `r * r = a.coeff 0` does
not, so `sqrt? (4 + x) 2` over `ℤ` returns `some (C 2)` at precision one
and `none` at precision two.

**A caller must not read `(inv? a).isSome` as "the constant term of `a`
is a unit".** At `n = 0` it is `true` and the constant term is `0`. The
right reading is "`a` is a unit of `TSeries R n`", which is what the
theorem says and what the caller almost always wants.

Each of these three theorems needs `[LawfulUnitOps R]` as well as
`[UnitOps R]`. Soundness of the `some` branch needs `inv?_eq` and the
`none` branch needs `inv?_isSome`, so both fields are load-bearing and
the statements name the lawful class.

**`sqrt` never searches for the constant root.** Finding a square root
in `R` is a problem in `R`: over `ZMod p` it is Tonelli-Shanks, over `ℤ`
it is an integer square root with an exactness test, and over `ℚ` it is
that twice. Putting a `SqrtOps R` class here would oblige this library
to carry instances for rings it does not depend on. The root is an
argument in both forms, and the choice of root is a real choice: `r` and
`-r` give the two square roots when `2` is a unit. What `sqrt?` does
look up is the inverse of `(1 + 1) * r`, which is what `UnitOps` is for.

## Newton iteration and the step count

Every doubling algorithm here uses one driver, and the driver is
structurally recursive on the step count rather than fuel-bounded.

```lean
/-- `newton step init k` applies `step` `k` times, passing the target
precision `2 ^ (j + 1)` at step `j`. -/
def newton (step : TSeries R n → Nat → TSeries R n)
    (init : TSeries R n) : Nat → TSeries R n
  | 0     => init
  | j + 1 => step (newton step init j) (2 ^ (j + 1))

/-- The number of doublings that reaches precision `n` from precision
`1`: zero when `n ≤ 1`, and `⌈log₂ n⌉` otherwise. -/
@[expose] def steps (n : Nat) : Nat := if n ≤ 1 then 0 else Nat.log2 (n - 1) + 1

theorem two_pow_steps_ge (n : Nat) : n ≤ 2 ^ steps n
```

**There is no fuel argument and therefore no fallback branch to
classify.** A fuel-bounded formulation would need a `none` or a junk
value on exhaustion, which design principle 8 would then require a
classification for, and the classification would be
`unreachable-by-pipeline-invariant` resting on exactly the theorem
`two_pow_steps_ge` above. Recursing on the step count directly discharges
that obligation by construction. Well-founded recursion on the
precision, halving, would also work and was rejected: it compiles to
`WellFounded.fix` and so to `Acc.rec`, which the kernel does not reduce,
and "Kernel exposure" below needs these to reduce.

`Nat.log2` is core Lean's floor base-two logarithm, and `steps` may use
it directly. It reduces in the kernel:
`example : Nat.log2 8 = 3 := by decide +kernel` is accepted on this
toolchain, because core elaborates `log2` to a `Nat.rec` on the argument
reused as a decreasing bound rather than to `WellFounded.fix`. So no
structurally recursive replacement of the kind hex-basic supplies for
`Array.ofFn` is needed here, and the implementation should recheck that
`decide +kernel` line rather than assume it.

`steps n` is `⌈log₂ n⌉`. The looser `Nat.log2 n + 1` is also a correct
bound and is easier to prove things about. It costs at most one extra
doubling, which is one extra full-precision multiplication. Either is
acceptable, and this SPEC states the tight form so that a later
implementation using the loose one is a recorded choice rather than an
accident.

**The step is bounded, which is what makes the total cost geometric.**
Step `j` calls `mulUpTo (2 ^ (j + 1))`, so it costs `O(M(2^j))` and the
sum over `j < steps n` is `O(M(n))` whenever `M` is monotone and
superadditive (`M(a) + M(b) ≤ M(a + b)`). "Growing at least linearly" is
not enough on its own, and both schoolbook `M(m) = m²` and the
Karatsuba and FFT replacements have the stronger property. Writing every
step at full precision `n` would be correct and would cost
`O(M(n) · log n)`, which is the mistake this paragraph exists to
prevent.

**The bounded discipline has to propagate, not stop at `mulUpTo`.** The
`exp` step calls `log`, and the reversion step calls `comp`. If those
run at full precision `n` the geometric sum collapses and the totals
become `O(M(n) log n)` and `O(comp(n) log n)`, even though every
multiplication inside them was bounded. So each of them has an internal
bounded form taking the target precision:

```lean
def invUpTo  (m : Nat) (a : TSeries R n) (u : R) : TSeries R n
def logUpTo  (m : Nat) [NatInverses R (n - 1)] (a : TSeries R n) : TSeries R n
def compUpTo (m : Nat) (a b : TSeries R n) : TSeries R n
```

each agreeing with the unbounded version below index `m` and zero above,
each costing what the unbounded version costs at precision `m`. The
public `exp`, `log`, `comp`, and `rev` are the `m = n` cases. An
implementation that omits these still gets the right answers and the
wrong complexity, which is why the bench family below compares ratios
across the ladder rather than checking a single precision.

Prefix agreement is the common statement of those guarantees:

```lean
def Agree (p : Nat) (a b : TSeries R n) : Prop :=
  ∀ i, i < n → i < p → a.coeff i = b.coeff i

theorem sqrtUpTo_agree (m : Nat) (hr : r * r = a.coeff 0)
    (hv : ((1 + 1) * r) * v = 1) :
    Agree m (sqrtUpTo m a r v) (sqrtOfRoot a r v)
theorem logUpTo_agree (m : Nat) (ha : (a - 1).coeff 0 = 0) :
    Agree m (logUpTo m a) (log a)
theorem expUpTo_agree (m : Nat) (ha : a.coeff 0 = 0) :
    Agree m (expUpTo m a) (exp a)
theorem revUpTo_agree (m : Nat) (h0 : b.coeff 0 = 0)
    (hv : b.coeff 1 * v = 1) :
    Agree m (revUpTo m b v) (revOfUnit b v)
```

The shared Newton iterator also exposes `steps_mono` and `newton_agree`:
increasing the target never decreases the iteration count, and later
iterates preserve every prefix certified stable by the step-specific proof.

One cost the arithmetic-operation count does not capture: each step
writes a `TSeries R n` of full length, so there is `Ω(n)` allocation or
copying per step and `Ω(n log n)` across the iteration. That is
dominated by `M(n)` at schoolbook multiplication. The reusable-buffer
implementation that design
principle 3 asks for (`Hex.Vector.modify` on a uniquely owned buffer) is
a requirement here rather than an optimisation.

The correctness statement common to all four Newton algorithms, written
schematically with `P` for the operation's defining equation:

```lean
theorem newton_correct (j : Nat) (i : Nat) (hi : i < min n (2 ^ j)) :
    P (newton step init j) i
```

Agreement to precision `min n (2 ^ j)` after `j` steps, hence full
agreement at `j = steps n`. Each algorithm instantiates it.

## Inverse

```lean
/-- The inverse of `a`, given an inverse `u` of its constant term. -/
def invOfUnit (a : TSeries R n) (u : R) : TSeries R n
def inv? [UnitOps R] (a : TSeries R n) : Option (TSeries R n)

theorem invOfUnit_mul (a : TSeries R n) (u : R) (hu : a.coeff 0 * u = 1) :
    a * invOfUnit a u = 1

theorem invOfUnit_unique (a b : TSeries R n) (u : R)
    (hu : a.coeff 0 * u = 1) (hb : a * b = 1) : b = invOfUnit a u
```

The iteration is `b ↦ b * (2 - a * b)`, started from `C u`, with both
products taken through `mulUpTo` at the step's target precision. At
`n = 0` the answer is the unique element and `hu` is unsatisfiable over
a nontrivial `R` (the zero ring satisfies it, and
`Lean.Grind.CommRing` permits the zero ring), which is why `inv?` and
not `invOfUnit` carries the `n = 0` case.

`invOfUnit_unique` is worth having and is short: the ring is
commutative, `a` is a unit, and inverses of a unit are unique. It is
what lets every later theorem say "the inverse" rather than "an
inverse".

**Against a naive baseline, Newton inversion has a bounded constant-factor
cost.** The linear recurrence
`b_i = -u · Σ_{j<i} a_{i-j} b_j` and schoolbook Newton both use `O(n²)`
coefficient operations. The benchmark therefore requires Newton to remain
within `4x` of the recurrence across the complete ladder; it does not claim a
speedup from a multiplication algorithm this library does not provide.

## Square root

```lean
/-- The square root of `a` with constant term `r`, given `v` inverting
`(1 + 1) * r`. -/
def sqrtOfRoot (a : TSeries R n) (r v : R) : TSeries R n
/-- The square root of `a` with constant term `r`, looking up the
inverse of `(1 + 1) * r` and checking that `r` really is a root of the
constant term. -/
def sqrt? [UnitOps R] (a : TSeries R n) (r : R) : Option (TSeries R n)

theorem sqrtOfRoot_sq (a : TSeries R n) (r v : R)
    (hr : r * r = a.coeff 0) (hv : ((1 + 1) * r) * v = 1) :
    sqrtOfRoot a r v * sqrtOfRoot a r v = a

theorem sqrtOfRoot_coeff_zero (hr : r * r = a.coeff 0)
    (hv : ((1 + 1) * r) * v = 1)
    (h : 0 < n) : (sqrtOfRoot a r v).coeff 0 = r

theorem sqrt_unique (s t : TSeries R n) (r v : R)
    (hv : ((1 + 1) * r) * v = 1)
    (hs : s * s = t * t)
    (hsr : s.coeff 0 = r) (htr : t.coeff 0 = r) : s = t
```

**One hypothesis, `(1 + 1) * r` invertible, rather than two.** In a
commutative ring a product is a unit exactly when both factors are, so
`((1 + 1) * r) * v = 1` says precisely that `1 + 1` is a unit and `r`
is a unit, and it is the quantity the iteration divides by. This spelling is
load-bearing in the Mathlib-free core, where no `OfNat R 2` instance is
assumed. Splitting it into two hypotheses would state the same thing less
usefully.

Both halves are needed, and two examples show that neither one alone is
enough. Over `ZMod 2` the constant root `r = 1` is a unit while `2` is
not, and `1 + x` has no square root at precision `2`: `(1 + ax)²` is
`1 + a²x²`, whose coefficient of `x` is `0` and never `1`. Over
`ZMod 9`, `2` is a unit (`2 * 5 = 1`) while the constant root `r = 3` is
not, and `x` has no square root with constant term `3` at precision `2`:
`(3 + bx)²` is `6bx`, and `6b = 1` has no solution. Over `ℤ` both halves
fail at once, which is why `4 + x` has constant root `r = 2` and a
square root `2 + x/4 + …` that is not integral.

The uniqueness proof is three lines and is the reason the constant root
is an argument. If `s² = t²` with `s` and `t` sharing the constant term
`r`, then `(s - t)(s + t) = 0` and `s + t` has constant term `2r`, a
unit, so `s + t` is a unit of `TSeries R n` and `s = t`.

**What that theorem says is "one lift per constant root", not "two
square roots".** A commutative ring can have more than two square roots
of a unit: `1` has four in `ℤ/15`, namely `1, 4, 11, 14`, and `2r` is a
unit for each. So a series over `ℤ/15` with constant term `1` has four
square roots, one above each of those, and the theorem separates them by
their constant term rather than counting them. `-r` is always among the
available roots and `sqrtOfRoot a (-r) (-v) = -sqrtOfRoot a r v`, but
that pair need not exhaust the roots and the SPEC does not claim it
does.

The iteration is on the **inverse** square root, `z ↦ z * (3 - a * z²) *
v'` where `v'` inverts `2`, followed by `sqrt a = a * z`. This avoids an
inversion inside the loop, which is the standard reason to prefer it.
Both constants it needs come from the one hypothesis: `v' = r * v`
inverts `2`, and the starting value `C (2 * v)` is the inverse of `r`.

## `exp` and `log`

```lean
/-- The integral with zero constant term. -/
def integrate [NatInverses R n] (a : TSeries R n) : TSeries R (n + 1)

def log [NatInverses R (n - 1)] (a : TSeries R n) : TSeries R n
def exp [NatInverses R (n - 1)] (a : TSeries R n) : TSeries R n

theorem coeff_integrate (i) (hi : i < n + 1) :
    (integrate a).coeff i = if i = 0 then 0 else NatInverses.invNat i * a.coeff (i - 1)

/-- `log` is characterised by its derivative, `(log a)' = a' / a`. Both
sides are at precision `n - 1`, which is where the `NatInverses` index
comes from. -/
theorem deriv_log (a : TSeries R n) (h : (a - 1).coeff 0 = 0) :
    (log a).deriv = a.deriv * (invOfUnit a 1).truncate (n - 1) (Nat.sub_le n 1)
theorem log_coeff_zero (a : TSeries R n) (h : (a - 1).coeff 0 = 0) (h0 : 0 < n) :
    (log a).coeff 0 = 0

theorem exp_coeff_zero (a : TSeries R n) (h : a.coeff 0 = 0) (h0 : 0 < n) :
    (exp a).coeff 0 = 1
theorem log_exp (a : TSeries R n) (h : a.coeff 0 = 0) : log (exp a) = a
theorem exp_log (a : TSeries R n) (h : (a - 1).coeff 0 = 0) : exp (log a) = a
theorem exp_add (a b : TSeries R n) (ha : a.coeff 0 = 0) (hb : b.coeff 0 = 0) :
    exp (a + b) = exp a * exp b
```

The `h` arguments on `deriv_log` and `log_coeff_zero` are part of the
uniform public logarithm contract and are retained for API stability. Their
individual proofs do not need the hypothesis because the total definition
always integrates with zero constant coefficient, but callers should not
have to switch theorem signatures when moving between the basic and inverse
logarithm laws.

`log a` is `integrate (deriv a * inv a)` followed by a truncation back
to `n`:

```lean
def log [NatInverses R (n - 1)] (a : TSeries R n) : TSeries R n :=
  (integrate (a.deriv * (invOfUnit a 1).truncate (n - 1) (Nat.sub_le n 1)))
    |>.truncate n (by omega)   -- `n ≤ n - 1 + 1`, and this is not `rfl`
```

**That final truncation is not decoration, and leaving it out does not
typecheck.** The inner value has precision `n - 1 + 1`, and `n - 1 + 1`
is `n` for every `n ≥ 1` but is `1` at `n = 0`, where truncated
subtraction floors. So the composite lands at precision `max n 1` and
has to come back down. Discovering this at implementation time rather
than here would be a small annoyance; discovering it by adding an
`n ≠ 0` hypothesis to `log` would be the wrong repair, since `log` is
total at precision zero.

`exp` is Newton on `y ↦ y * (1 + a - log y)`, started from `1`. The
iterates all have constant term `1`, which is what keeps `log y`
applicable at every step.

**Neither `exp` nor `log` takes `[UnitOps R]`, and that omission is
load-bearing.** The only inversion either one performs is
`invOfUnit a 1`, whose witness is the literal `1`, so nothing is
searched for. Carrying `[UnitOps R]` would be harmless here but would
make the companion's `[Algebra ℚ R]` correspondence theorems
unstatable, since a general `ℚ`-algebra has no decidable unit
operation. The rule from "Failure behaviour" is what saves it: the
witness-taking form is primary, and `UnitOps` appears only on the forms
that look a witness up.

**The index `n - 1` in the `NatInverses` hypothesis is exact, and the
truncated subtraction is doing real work.** `integrate` from precision
`n - 1` to precision `n` divides by `1` through `n - 1`. At `n = 0` and
`n = 1` the hypothesis is `NatInverses R 0`, which every ring satisfies
vacuously, and indeed `exp` and `log` need no division at those
precisions. At `n = 2` it is `NatInverses R 1`, which every ring
satisfies since `1` is a unit. At `n = 3` it first has content, and
`ℤ` first fails: `log (1 + x)` at precision `3` is `x - x²/2`.

**`log`'s hypothesis is `(a - 1).coeff 0 = 0` and not `a.coeff 0 = 1`.**
The two agree whenever `n ≥ 1`, and at `n = 0` the first is true (both
sides are out of range) while the second is false over a nontrivial `R`.
Since `log` is total at precision `0`, the first is the hypothesis that
does not exclude a case the conclusion covers.

**Mathlib's `PowerSeries.exp` is not general enough to transport, and
that is a fact about Mathlib rather than about this library.**
`PowerSeries.exp` (`Mathlib/RingTheory/PowerSeries/Exp.lean:48`) is
defined for `[Algebra ℚ A]`, so it does not exist over `ZMod p` at any
precision, while `exp` here exists over `ZMod p` for prime `p` at
every precision up to and including `p`. The companion therefore states the `[Algebra ℚ R]`
correspondence with Mathlib's series and keeps the functional equations
above as the general statements. This is recorded in "The Mathlib layer"
as a candidate for upstreaming rather than as a gap here.

## Composition

```lean
/-- `a ∘ b`, the substitution of `b` into `a`. -/
def comp (a b : TSeries R n) : TSeries R n
def comp? (a b : TSeries R n) : Option (TSeries R n)

/-- The defining equation: `a ∘ b` is `Σ_{k < n} a_k · b^k`, written as a
fold because there is no `Finset` here. -/
theorem comp_spec (a b : TSeries R n) (h : b.coeff 0 = 0) :
    comp a b = (List.range n).foldl (fun acc k => acc + C (a.coeff k) * b.pow k) 0

theorem comp_X_right (a) : comp a X = a
theorem comp_X_left  (b) (h : b.coeff 0 = 0) : comp X b = b
theorem comp_mul (a a' b) (h : b.coeff 0 = 0) : comp (a * a') b = comp a b * comp a' b
```

**The hypothesis `b.coeff 0 = 0` is not a convenience.** With
`b.coeff 0 = c` nonzero, the constant coefficient of `a ∘ b` is
`Σ_k a_k c^k`, an infinite sum with no meaning in a general commutative
ring. Take `a = 1 + x + x² + …` and `b = 1`: the answer would be
`1 + 1 + 1 + …`.

**The hypothesis is sufficient rather than necessary, and this SPEC
takes the stronger one deliberately.** Two weaker conditions do work.
For full power series the condition is that `b`'s constant term is
nilpotent, which is what Mathlib's `PowerSeries.HasSubst` requires
(`Mathlib/RingTheory/PowerSeries/Substitution.lean:40`, `HasSubst a :=
IsNilpotent (constantCoeff a)`). On the truncation `R[x]/(x^n)`
specifically, the exact condition for the sum to descend is `b ^ n = 0`,
which is weaker still. Both are refused here: neither is decidable in a
general `R`, admitting either would put a further class on the
interface, and no consumer in this tree wants it. What the SPEC claims
is that `b.coeff 0 = 0` is a clean uniform sufficient condition, not
that composition is undefined without it.

`comp?` returns `none` when `b.coeff 0 ≠ 0`, and `n = 0` succeeds
because the coefficient is out of range there. Note that `comp?`
accepts `b.coeff 0 = 0` even though `0` is a nonunit, so the "constant
term a nonunit" column of the audit table below is not the relevant test
for this row.

Two algorithms, with the second the intended one:

- **Horner**, starting from `C a_{n-1}` and applying
  `acc ↦ acc * b + C a_k` for `k` from `n - 2` down to `0`. That is `n`
  truncated multiplications, `O(n · M(n))`.
- **Brent-Kung**, splitting `a` into `⌈√n⌉` blocks of `⌈√n⌉` coefficients,
  computing the powers `b^0 … b^{⌈√n⌉}` once, evaluating each block by a
  coefficient-matrix product, then combining by Horner in `b^{⌈√n⌉}`.
  `O(√n)` truncated multiplications plus `O(n²)` coefficient operations
  for the block products. Brent and Kung, "Fast algorithms for
  manipulating formal power series" (JACM 25, 1978).

Brent-Kung is a real improvement even at schoolbook multiplication,
`O(n^{2.5})` against Horner's `O(n³)`. The crossover between them is a
measured number and this SPEC does not guess it. The near-linear
composition algorithms published since 2024 are out of scope and are
recorded in the open questions.

## Reversion

```lean
/-- The compositional inverse of `b`, given `v` inverting `b.coeff 1`. -/
def revOfUnit (b : TSeries R n) (v : R) : TSeries R n
def rev? [UnitOps R] (b : TSeries R n) : Option (TSeries R n)
/-- Direct evaluation of the Lagrange coefficient formula. -/
def revLagrange [NatInverses R (n - 1)]
    (b : TSeries R n) (v : R) : TSeries R n

theorem revOfUnit_comp (b : TSeries R n) (v : R)
    (h0 : b.coeff 0 = 0) (hv : b.coeff 1 * v = 1) :
    comp b (revOfUnit b v) = X ∧ comp (revOfUnit b v) b = X

theorem revOfUnit_coeff_one (h0 : b.coeff 0 = 0) (hv : b.coeff 1 * v = 1)
    (h : 1 < n) : (revOfUnit b v).coeff 1 = v

theorem revLagrange_eq [NatInverses R (n - 1)]
    (h0 : b.coeff 0 = 0) (hv : b.coeff 1 * v = 1) :
    revLagrange b v = revOfUnit b v

/-- At precision one there is no linear coefficient, and the only series
with zero constant term is `0`, which reverts to itself. -/
theorem rev_le_one (b : TSeries R n) (hn : n ≤ 1) (h0 : b.coeff 0 = 0) :
    comp b 0 = X ∧ comp 0 b = X
```

`revOfUnit_comp` covers `n ≥ 2` and `rev_le_one` covers `n ≤ 1`, where
`hv` has no solution over a nontrivial `R`. Together they are what
`rev?_isSome_iff` is proved from, and `rev?` dispatches on `n ≤ 1`
before consulting `UnitOps` for the same reason.

The iteration is Newton on `y ↦ y - (b ∘ y - x) / (b' ∘ y)`, started
from `C v * X`, doubling the precision each step. Both compositions run
at the step's target precision, and the division is `invOfUnit` applied
to `b' ∘ y`, whose constant term is `b.coeff 1`.

**`deriv` drops a precision and `comp` does not mix precisions, so the
derivative used here is the zero-padded one.** `b.deriv` has type
`TSeries R (n - 1)` while `y` has type `TSeries R n`, so `comp b.deriv y`
is not a well-typed call. The routine uses

```lean
/-- The derivative kept at the input precision, with the top
coefficient set to zero because computing it would need `a.coeff n`. -/
def derivPad (a : TSeries R n) : TSeries R n
theorem coeff_derivPad (i) (hi : i < n) :
    (derivPad a).coeff i = if i + 1 < n then ((i + 1 : Nat) : R) * a.coeff (i + 1) else 0
```

and the correctness proof rests on one lemma saying the missing top
coefficient is never read:

```lean
/-- At the step from precision `k` to `2k`, the numerator has valuation
at least `k`, so the product reads the inverted denominator only below
precision `k`. -/
theorem rev_numerator_valuation (i : Nat) (hi : i < k) :
    (comp b y - X).coeff i = 0
```

Every step has `k < n`, hence `k ≤ n - 1`, so `derivPad b ∘ y` is only
ever read below index `n - 1`, where it agrees with the true derivative.
Writing this obligation down is the point: an implementation that
reaches for a mixed-precision `comp` instead is solving a harder problem
than the algorithm poses.

**The route is Newton and not the direct Lagrange formula, and the
reason is the whole point of this section.** Lagrange inversion gives
the answer in closed form,

```text
[x^k] rev(b) = (1/k) · [x^{k-1}] (x / b)^k,
```

and evaluating that expression as written divides by `k` for every
`k < n`. Implemented directly it therefore needs `NatInverses R (n - 1)`
and refuses `ℤ` beyond precision `2`. But the reversion **does** exist
over `ℤ`: reverting `x + x²` gives `x - x² + 2x³ - 5x⁴ + …`, integer
coefficients throughout. So an implementation that evaluates the formula
literally carries a hypothesis its own answers do not need.

**The precise claim, since the loose one is false.** The reversion
coefficients are integer polynomials in the coefficients of `b` and in
`b₁⁻¹`, so the division by `k` in Lagrange's formula always cancels, and
division-free rearrangements of Lagrange inversion exist. What needs
`NatInverses` is the direct `1/k` evaluation, not the theorem. This SPEC
does not claim that reversion is impossible without integer inverses; it
claims that the obvious implementation of it is, and picks a route that
is not.

The Newton route uses only `comp`, which needs no invertibility at all,
and `invOfUnit` of a series whose constant term is `b.coeff 1`, which
the stated hypothesis already provides. It has no integer division
anywhere.

This is the concrete case behind the general rule for this library: an
algorithm's hypotheses are the hypotheses **that algorithm** needs, and
choosing an algorithm whose hypotheses exceed the operation's is a
design error rather than a harmless implementation detail. The direct
Lagrange evaluation stays available as a second route, used only when
`NatInverses` is in scope, where it is a useful cross-check in the
conformance suite.

Cost is `O(log n)` compositions, dominated by the last, so `O(comp(n))`.

## Degenerate-input audit

Every operation at precision `0`, and at a noninvertible constant or
linear term. This table is the checklist a reviewer runs against the
implementation.

| `rev?` | `some` | `some` iff `coeff 0 = 0` | `none` when `coeff 0 ≠ 0`, at every `n` | `none` for `n ≥ 2` |

Three of those rows deserve a statement in prose, because an
implementation gets them wrong in the same way each time.

**`inv?` and `rev?` succeed at precision `0` with no test.** The
constant term is out of range and the answer is the unique element of
the zero ring, which does satisfy `a * b = 1`. An implementation that
tests `UnitOps.inv? (a.coeff 0)` first returns `none` there over any
nontrivial `R`, contradicting `inv?_isSome_iff`. The test is guarded by
`0 < n`.

**`rev?` drops the test on the linear term at precision `1` and keeps
the test on the constant term.** There is no linear term, `X = 0`, and
the only series with zero constant term is `0`, whose compositional
inverse is itself, so an implementation that tests
`UnitOps.inv? (b.coeff 1)` wrongly returns `none`. But the constant-term
test survives: `rev? (C 1 : TSeries R 1)` is `none`, because
`comp (C 1) y = C 1` for every `y` and `C 1 ≠ 0 = X` over a nontrivial
`R`. The condition is `b.coeff 0 = 0 ∧ (n ≤ 1 ∨ …)`, with the
disjunction inside, and writing it as `n ≤ 1 ∨ (b.coeff 0 = 0 ∧ …)`
claims every precision-one series is reversible, which is false.

`sqrt?` splits the same way and in the same place. At `n ≤ 1` the
unitality of `(1 + 1) * r` is irrelevant, since `C r` squares to `C (r * r)`
and nothing has to be lifted, but `r * r = a.coeff 0` still has to hold.
So `sqrt? (4 + x) 2` over `ℤ` is `some (C 2)` at precision one and
`none` at precision two.

**`exp` and `log` at precisions `0` and `1` use no integer inverse.**
The `NatInverses R (n - 1)` hypothesis is `NatInverses R 0`, which is
vacuous, so these calls typecheck over `ℤ` and over any ring at all. An
implementation that fetches `invNat 1` unconditionally still typechecks
(the instance provides `invNat` as a total function) but computes with a
value the laws say nothing about. The fixture set covers precision `0`
and `1` over `ℤ` for exactly this reason.

## Complexity

`M(m)` is the cost of `mulUpToImpl m` in coefficient operations: `O(m²)`
for the current schoolbook implementation.

| operation | algorithm | cost |
|---|---|---|
| `+`, `-`, `truncate`, `extend`, `deriv`, `integrate` | coefficientwise | `O(n)` |
| `*` | convolution | `M(n)` |
| `pow k` | square-and-multiply | `O(log k) · M(n)` |
| `invOfUnit` | Newton, bounded steps | `O(M(n))` |
| `sqrtOfRoot` | Newton on the inverse root | `O(M(n))` |
| `log` | `integrate (deriv · inv)` | `O(M(n))` |
| `exp` | Newton with a `log` per step | `O(M(n))` |
| `comp` | Horner | `O(n · M(n))` |
| `comp` | Brent-Kung | `O(√n · M(n) + n²)` |
| `rev` | Newton with a `comp` per step | `O(comp(n))` |

The geometric sum is the load-bearing claim in the three Newton rows,
and it holds only because the step is bounded:
`Σ_{j < ⌈log₂ n⌉} M(2^j) = O(M(n))` whenever `M` is at least linear and
superadditive.

At schoolbook multiplication the inverse, square root, `exp`, and `log`
rows all tie the naive linear recurrence for the same operation, which
is `O(n²)` in each case, and lose on the constant: bounded Newton
inversion does `(4/3)n²` coefficient multiplications against the
recurrence's `n²/2`. Only composition and reversion win outright today.
These are coefficient-operation bounds. The exact-`Rat` benchmark ladders
also declare their coefficient-bit-growth normalization explicitly so that a
wallclock verdict does not pretend arbitrary-precision operations are
constant-time.

## Kernel exposure

The replay closure is `coeff`, `add`, `mul`, `convCoeff`, and equality
on `TSeries R n`, together with whatever the coefficient ring exposes.
Each is `@[expose]`, and a downstream module carries a `decide +kernel`
test over `TSeries Int 8` that fails if any of them stops reducing.

Equality is where this would silently break. `Vector`'s derived
`DecidableEq` does not reduce across a module boundary, which is why
hex-basic carries `Hex.instDecidableEqVector`
(`HexBasic/ArrayDecEq.lean`) and why `Hex.Vector.ofFn'`
(`HexBasic/OfFn.lean`) exists beside it. Both are `scoped`, so
`HexTruncatedSeries` modules activate them inside `namespace Hex` and
they do not leak to consumers. A module that forgets gets a stuck
`decide`, which is loud rather than silent.

The Newton driver is in the closure, which is the second reason it is
structurally recursive on the step count. A well-founded recursion on
the precision compiles to `Acc.rec` and would not reduce, and the
`decide +kernel` test would fail on `inv` at every precision.

The composition and reversion routines are **not** in the closure. They
are search-free but expensive, no proof term mentions them, and exposing
them would put the Brent-Kung block decomposition into the kernel for no
benefit.

## Conformance

Fixtures follow [SPEC/testing.md](../../SPEC/testing.md). A Lean driver at
`conformance/HexTruncatedSeries/EmitFixtures.lean` exposed as
`lean_exe hextruncatedseries_emit_fixtures`, a committed snapshot at
`conformance-fixtures/HexTruncatedSeries/series.jsonl`, and an oracle
driver at `scripts/oracle/series_sympy.py`. One tuple appended to
`ORACLES` in `scripts/ci/run_oracles.sh`:

```
"HexTruncatedSeries|hextruncatedseries_emit_fixtures|scripts/oracle/series_sympy.py|conformance-fixtures/HexTruncatedSeries/series.jsonl"
```

**The oracle is SymPy's `sympy.polys.ring_series`.** It is a truncated
power series implementation with the same operation set and the same
"precision is an argument" convention: `rs_mul`, `rs_pow`, `rs_trunc`,
`rs_series_inversion`, `rs_nth_root`, `rs_exp`, `rs_log`, `rs_subs` for
composition, and `rs_series_reversion`. SymPy is already installed for
the oracle job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:77`), so no new dependency is
needed. python-flint is a performance comparator rather than the oracle;
see "Benchmarking".

**Coefficient domains are chosen so that every emitted operation has an
oracle.** Over `Rat`, SymPy's `ring('x', QQ)` covers the whole surface,
so every operation is emitted there. Over `Int`, `ring('x', ZZ)` covers
the ring operations, `inv` at unit constant term, composition and
reversion, and it covers `exp` and `log` only at precisions `0` through
`2`; those are exactly the precisions where `NatInverses Int (n - 1)`
holds, so nothing is emitted that cannot be checked. Testing.md's rule 2
forbids emitting an operation on an input class that gets a weaker
contract, so the `Int` fixtures at precision `3` and above simply do not
include `exp` and `log`.

Cases that must be present:

- Every operation at precision `0` and at precision `1`, over `Int` and
  over `Rat`. This is the audit table above turned into fixtures, and it
  is the half of the suite most likely to catch a real bug.
- `inv?` on an input with a nonunit constant term over `Int` (`2 + x`),
  expecting `none`, at precisions `0`, `1`, and `4`. Precision `0` must
  give `some`.
- `rev?` on `x + x²` over `Int` at precisions `0` through `6`, checking
  the integer coefficients `0, 1, -1, 2, -5, 14` and checking that no
  integer division happened. Precisions `0` and `1` must give `some`.
- `rev?` on `2x + x²` over `Int`, expecting `none` for `n ≥ 2` (the
  linear coefficient `2` is not a unit of `ℤ`) and `some` for `n ≤ 1`.
- `rev? (C 1 : TSeries Int 1)`, expecting `none`. Precision one drops
  the linear-coefficient test and keeps the constant-term test, and an
  implementation that reads the success condition as
  `n ≤ 1 ∨ …` returns `some` here.
- `sqrtOfRoot` over `Rat` on `1 + x` with `r = 1` and with `r = -1`,
  checking the two answers are negatives of each other.
- `sqrt?` over `Int` on `4 + x` with `r = 2`, expecting `some (C 2)` at
  precisions `0` and `1` and `none` from precision `2` on, because
  `(1 + 1) * r = 4` is not a unit of `ℤ` but nothing needs lifting below
  precision `2`.
- `sqrt?` over `Rat` on `1 + x` with `r = 2`, expecting `none` because
  `2 * 2 ≠ 1 = a.coeff 0`. This is the check on the other half of
  `sqrt?_isSome_iff`, which an implementation that only tests `(1 + 1) * r`
  for unitality fails.
- `exp` and `log` over `Rat` at precisions `1` through `16`, with
  `log (exp a) = a` and `exp (a + b) = exp a * exp b` checked in Lean as
  differential tests beside the oracle comparison.
- Composition where the inner series has a nonzero constant term,
  expecting `none` from `comp?` at every precision above `0`.
- Composition of `1/(1-x)` with `x + x²` at precision `12`, which is the
  case where a Horner implementation and a Brent-Kung implementation
  must agree; both routes are emitted and compared.
- Reversion by the Newton route and by Lagrange inversion over `Rat`,
  compared against each other and against SymPy. Over `Int` only the
  Newton route is emitted, since Lagrange inversion has no `Int`
  instance to run under, and that asymmetry is itself the check that the
  hypothesis is where the SPEC says it is.
- `extend` followed by `*` against `*` followed by `extend` on `X` at
  precision `2`, recording the documented disagreement so that a later
  "simplification" that makes `extend` multiplicative fails the suite.
- `divXPow?` at `k` larger than the precision, and `divXPow?` on an
  input whose bottom `k` coefficients are not all zero.

## Benchmarking

Per [SPEC/benchmarking.md](../../SPEC/benchmarking.md), with drivers at
`bench/HexTruncatedSeries/Bench.lean`. Native and kernel: the kernel
suite measures `decide +kernel` on a `TSeries Int 8` product, which is
what a downstream proof pays.

Families:

- **Multiplication**, precisions 8 to 4096 over `Int` and `Rat`. The
  production schoolbook baseline every other family is read against.
- **Inverse**, the same ladder, Newton against the linear recurrence.
- **`exp` and `log`**, precisions 8 to 1024 over `Rat`.
- **Square root**, the same ladder over `Rat`.
- **Composition**, precisions 8 to 512, Horner against Brent-Kung. This
  family is what fixes the crossover the SPEC declines to guess.
- **Reversion**, precisions 8 to 512, Newton against Lagrange inversion
  over `Rat`.

**Comparators.** FLINT's truncated series operations on `fmpq_poly`
(`fmpq_poly_inv_series`, `fmpq_poly_exp_series`, `fmpq_poly_log_series`,
`fmpq_poly_sqrt_series`, `fmpq_poly_compose_series`,
`fmpq_poly_revert_series`) are for orientation only, with no target
ratio. The rationale is structural and is the same one hex-poly records for
rational polynomial operations: FLINT's series routines are built on tuned,
coefficient-specific Karatsuba/Toom-Cook/FFT multiplication, while this
library uses a generic schoolbook kernel. The ratio therefore
continues to measure a known kernel gap rather than only the Newton iteration.

Two required internal checks, which matter more than the external one:

- **Newton inversion within `4x` of the linear recurrence** at every
  precision on the ladder. Not faster, and the threshold is a counted
  number rather than a guess. Bounded Newton does
  `Σ_{m = 2, 4, …, n} m²` coefficient multiplications, which is
  `(4/3)n²`, against the recurrence's `n²/2`, a ratio approaching
  `8/3 ≈ 2.67` from above (`2.83` at precision 16, `2.67` by precision
  1024). `4x` leaves room for the difference in memory traffic and no
  more. A regression past it means the step is not bounded, which is the
  one implementation mistake that turns `O(M(n))` into `O(M(n) log n)`
  and shows up as a ratio growing with the precision rather than
  settling.
- **The Brent-Kung to Horner ratio improves monotonically along the
  ladder**, and Brent-Kung wins at the top rung. Composition is the one
  family where the fast route pays before a fast multiplication exists,
  so this check is the evidence that Brent-Kung was implemented rather
  than declared. It is deliberately *not* stated as "faster above
  precision 64": this SPEC says elsewhere that it does not guess the
  crossover, and naming one here would contradict that. The measured
  crossover becomes the threshold once the family has run.

The bench target imports `HexTruncatedSeries`, which imports `HexBasic`
and `Std` and nothing else, so the Mathlib-free requirement of
[SPEC/benchmarking.md](../../SPEC/benchmarking.md) is met without further
argument.

## The Mathlib layer

`hex-truncated-series-mathlib` identifies the type with `PowerSeries R`
modulo `X ^ n` and identifies each operation with its Mathlib
counterpart.

Its authoritative source-local specification is
[hex-truncated-series-mathlib](../../HexTruncatedSeriesMathlib/SPEC/hex-truncated-series-mathlib.md).
The declarations below summarize the boundary from the computational
library's point of view.

```lean
/-- Truncation of a power series to precision `n`. -/
def ofPowerSeries (f : PowerSeries R) : TSeries R n

theorem coeff_ofPowerSeries (f) (i) (hi : i < n) :
    (ofPowerSeries (n := n) f).coeff i = PowerSeries.coeff i f

/-- Truncation is a surjective ring homomorphism with kernel `(X ^ n)`. -/
def ofPowerSeriesHom : PowerSeries R →+* TSeries R n
theorem ofPowerSeriesHom_surjective : Function.Surjective (ofPowerSeriesHom (R := R) (n := n))
theorem ker_ofPowerSeriesHom :
    RingHom.ker (ofPowerSeriesHom (R := R) (n := n))
      = Ideal.span {(PowerSeries.X : PowerSeries R) ^ n}

/-- Hence the identification the library is named for. -/
def quotEquiv :
    (PowerSeries R ⧸ Ideal.span {(PowerSeries.X : PowerSeries R) ^ n}) ≃+* TSeries R n
```

`quotEquiv` is `RingHom.quotientKerEquivOfSurjective` applied to the two
theorems above, so the substance is the surjectivity and the kernel
computation and the equivalence is a corollary. Stating the ring
homomorphism first is what makes each operation's correspondence a
single equation rather than a transport through an equivalence.

The operation correspondences, each of the form "truncating commutes
with the operation":

```lean
theorem ofPowerSeries_invOfUnit (f : PowerSeries R) (u : Rˣ)
    (hu : PowerSeries.constantCoeff f = u) :
    ofPowerSeries (n := n) (f.invOfUnit u) = invOfUnit (ofPowerSeries f) u.inv

theorem ofPowerSeries_subst (f g : PowerSeries R)
    (hg : PowerSeries.constantCoeff g = 0) :
    ofPowerSeries (n := n) (f.subst g) = comp (ofPowerSeries f) (ofPowerSeries g)

theorem ofPowerSeries_substInvOfIsUnit (g : PowerSeries R)
    (h0 : PowerSeries.constantCoeff g = 0) (hu : IsUnit (PowerSeries.coeff 1 g)) :
    ofPowerSeries (n := n) (g.substInvOfIsUnit hu)
      = revOfUnit (ofPowerSeries g) ((hu.unit⁻¹ : Rˣ) : R)

theorem ofPowerSeries_exp [Algebra ℚ R] [NatInverses R (n - 1)]
    (f : PowerSeries R)
    (h : PowerSeries.constantCoeff f = 0) :
    ofPowerSeries (n := n) ((PowerSeries.exp R).subst f) = exp (ofPowerSeries f)

theorem ofPowerSeries_logOf [Algebra ℚ R] [NatInverses R (n - 1)]
    (f : PowerSeries R)
    (h : PowerSeries.constantCoeff f = 1) :
    ofPowerSeries (n := n) (PowerSeries.logOf f) = log (ofPowerSeries f)
```

**Two hypotheses above are not optional, and dropping either makes the
theorem false.**

`hu : PowerSeries.constantCoeff f = u` is required because Mathlib's
`invOfUnit f u` uses whatever `u` it is handed: `constantCoeff_invOfUnit`
says the result always has constant term `↑u⁻¹`, and `mul_invOfUnit`
(`Mathlib/RingTheory/PowerSeries/Inverse.lean:102`) carries exactly this
hypothesis. Without it the two sides are junk in different ways. Over
`ℚ` at `n = 2` with `f = C 2` and `u = 1`, Mathlib's result has constant
term `1` while the Newton iteration here sends `1` to `1 * (2 - 2) = 0`.

`hg : PowerSeries.constantCoeff g = 0` is required, and stating it as
Mathlib's `HasSubst g` instead would be **false**. `HasSubst` is
nilpotence of the constant coefficient, not vanishing
(`Mathlib/RingTheory/PowerSeries/Substitution.lean:40`), and this
library's `comp` is the stricter operation. Over `ZMod 4` at `n = 1`
with `f = X` and `g = C 2`, `HasSubst g` holds because `2 ^ 2 = 0`, and

```text
ofPowerSeries (f.subst g)                 = C 2
comp (ofPowerSeries f) (ofPowerSeries g)  = comp 0 (C 2) = 0
```

so the two sides differ. `HasSubst.of_constantCoeff_zero'` derives what
`subst` needs from the stated hypothesis, which is the right direction.

**The companion has to build Mathlib's `CommRing (TSeries R n)`
itself.** The `Ideal`, quotient, and `≃+*` statements above all need
Mathlib's class, and the Mathlib-free layer supplies only
`Lean.Grind.CommRing`. `Mathlib/Algebra/Ring/GrindInstances.lean` gives
`CommRing.toGrindCommRing` and pointedly refuses the reverse: the file
carries the converse construction as an `example` with a comment saying
"this direction should never be used", because it is not definitionally
the original structure. So the instance is built from the executable
operations here, following `HexPolyFpMathlib.commRing`
(`HexPolyFpMathlib/Basic.lean:385`), which uses
`CommRing.ofMinimalAxioms` and pins `sub` and `neg` to the executable
ones. That pinning is the part worth copying: leaving Mathlib's defaults
would put two different subtractions on the type and Mathlib's lemmas
would not fire on the spelling callers write.

`quotEquiv` is likewise two steps rather than one.
`RingHom.quotientKerEquivOfSurjective` produces a quotient by the
literal `RingHom.ker`, so reaching the quotient by
`Ideal.span {X ^ n}` means transporting along `ker_ofPowerSeriesHom`
with `Ideal.quotEquivOfEq` first and composing.

The companion also supplies `NatInverses R m` from `[Algebra ℚ R]`, for
every `m`, since nothing else constructs that class from a Mathlib
hypothesis.

**Three notes on what Mathlib has and does not have**, because they
decide the shape of the companion.

Mathlib's reversion is `PowerSeries.substInvOfIsUnit`
(`Mathlib/RingTheory/PowerSeries/Substitution.lean:566`), with
`subst_substInvOfIsUnit_left` and `subst_substInvOfIsUnit_right` under
exactly the hypotheses this library uses: zero constant coefficient and
a unit linear coefficient. So the reversion correspondence is a genuine
transport and not a restatement.

Mathlib's `exp` and `logOf` need `[Algebra ℚ A]`
(`Mathlib/RingTheory/PowerSeries/Exp.lean:43`,
`Mathlib/RingTheory/PowerSeries/Log.lean:82`), which is strictly stronger
than `NatInverses R (n - 1)`. The two correspondence theorems above are
therefore stated under `[Algebra ℚ R]` and cover less than the
Mathlib-free `exp` and `log` do. Nothing is lost: the functional
equations `log_exp`, `exp_log`, and `exp_add` are proved Mathlib-free
and hold over `ZMod p` for prime `p` at every precision up to `p`,
where Mathlib's
`exp` does not exist. A precision-indexed `PowerSeries.expTrunc` would
fix this upstream and is recorded in the open questions.

Mathlib has no square root of a power series.
`Mathlib/RingTheory/PowerSeries/Binomial.lean` has `binomialSeries`,
which would give `(1 + X)^(1/2)` over a `BinomialRing`, but that
hypothesis is not the one this library uses and the special case is not
stated. The companion therefore proves an existence and uniqueness
statement itself,

```lean
theorem exists_unique_sq (f : PowerSeries R) (r : R)
    (hr : r * r = PowerSeries.constantCoeff f) (hu : IsUnit (2 * r)) :
    ∃! s : PowerSeries R, s * s = f ∧ PowerSeries.constantCoeff s = r
```

which is the `PowerSeries` version of `sqrt_unique` above and is a good
upstream candidate.

Following the project split, no theorem about `TSeries` belongs in the
companion beyond these and one correspondence lemma per public
operation.

## Milestones

1. **The type and the ring.** `TSeries`, `coeff`, `ofFn`, `ext`,
   `DecidableEq`, the ring operations, `mulUpTo`, its allocation-conscious
   schoolbook `mulUpToImpl`, and the
   `Lean.Grind.CommRing` instance. The `decide +kernel` test lands here,
   because that is when the `Vector` instance choice is still cheap to
   change.

2. **Precision changes.** `truncate`, `extend`, `mulXPow`, `divXPow?`,
   `valuation?`, `deriv`, `integrate`, `NatInverses`, and the
   preservation and loss theorems. `truncate_mul` is the theorem the
   rest of the library rests on and it is proved here.

3. **The Newton driver and inversion.** `newton`, `steps`,
   `two_pow_steps_ge`, `invOfUnit`, `inv?`, `invOfUnit_mul`,
   `invOfUnit_unique`, and the degenerate-precision cases of
   `inv?_isSome_iff`. At the end of it the library has a working
   quasi-linear-ready inverse and the hardest infrastructure proof is
   done.

4. **Square root, `exp`, and `log`.** `sqrtOfRoot`, `sqrt?`,
   `sqrt_unique`, then `exp` and `log` with the functional equations.
   The `NatInverses Int 1` boundary case is exercised here, since it is
   the case a later refactor is most likely to lose.

5. **Composition and reversion.** Horner first, then Brent-Kung, then
   Newton reversion, then Lagrange inversion as the second route under
   `NatInverses`.

6. **The companion**, and the conformance and bench suites.

`libraries.yml` gains:

```yaml
  HexTruncatedSeries:
    deps: [HexBasic]
    mathlib: false
    done_through: 0
    status: planned
  HexTruncatedSeriesMathlib:
    deps: [HexTruncatedSeries]
    mathlib: true
    done_through: 0
    status: planned
```

`HexBasic` is the only computational dependency, and the check that
matters when the library is scaffolded is that it stays that way:
`scripts/check_dag.py` cross-checks `libraries.yml` against the
lakefile, so an accidental `import HexPoly` fails there rather than at
release time.

## Open questions

- **Where the convolution fold should live.** hex-poly has it
  (`HexPoly/Euclid/MulRing.lean`) and this library will have its own,
  because hex-poly declares no dependencies and so cannot import
  `HexBasic`. The same constraint already forces hex-poly to hand-copy
  `HexBasic.ArrayDecEq`'s workaround (`HexPoly/Dense.lean:45-54`). Giving
  hex-poly a dependency on hex-basic would let both use one copy of both
  things, and it is a change to hex-poly rather than to this library, so
  it is recorded here and decided there.
- **Whether `ZMod64 p` instances belong here.** `NatInverses (ZMod64 p) m`
  for `m < p` and `UnitOps (ZMod64 p)` are the instances that make `exp`,
  `log`, and `sqrt` useful over a small prime field, and they need
  hex-mod-arith. Adding that dependency would give the series library a
  second edge for the sake of two instances. The alternative is that
  hex-poly-fp, or a small `hex-truncated-series-modular`, supplies
  them. The measurement that settles it is whether any consumer wants
  the modular instances without also wanting hex-poly.
- **The Horner/Brent-Kung crossover**, and whether Brent-Kung's block
  size should be `⌈√n⌉` or tuned. Both are measured numbers and this
  SPEC does not guess them.
- **Whether a subtraction-capable fast multiplication API belongs here.**
  Three-product Karatsuba cannot implement the current semiring-generic
  `mulUpTo` signature. Any future fast path needs an explicitly stronger
  coefficient interface and a dispatch design that the Newton callers can
  actually select.
- **Whether near-linear composition belongs here later.** Kinoshita and
  Li, "Power series composition in near-linear time" (2024), supersedes
  Brent-Kung asymptotically. It is out of scope
  now because its constant factor is unmeasured in this setting and
  because Brent-Kung is the algorithm with an accessible correctness
  argument. Worth revisiting once composition is a measured bottleneck
  in a real consumer.
- **Whether a precision-indexed `exp` belongs upstream.** Mathlib's
  `PowerSeries.exp` needs `[Algebra ℚ A]` and so cannot speak about
  `ZMod p` at any precision, while the truncated `exp` here exists at
  every precision up to and including `p`. An upstream `PowerSeries.expTrunc` under a
  precision-indexed hypothesis would let the companion transport rather
  than restate. The same applies to the square root, where Mathlib has
  no statement at all.
- **Whether `steps n` should be `⌈log₂ n⌉` or `Nat.log2 n + 1`.** The
  loose bound costs at most one extra full-precision multiplication and
  may have a much easier proof of `two_pow_steps_ge`. This is a decision
  to make with the proof in hand, and the cost of getting it wrong is
  one multiplication.
